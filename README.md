# [Meropi's Garden](https://whichperson.com)
Flowers can hear buzzing bees... Did you know? I had no idea.    

Welcome to my online space where I keep track of things I enjoyed creating, researching, and learning. This is an ever-evolving garden; always expanding to grow new flowers.

## FAQ
People like to ask questions. 

### 1. Which person?
Linux command `which` + me, a `person` = `which person` ðŸ¤¯

### 2. Why a garden?
I just love flowers. If you like flowers, too, contact me at `meropi.l@outlook.com` as soon as possible.
