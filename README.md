# [Meropi's Room](https://whichperson.com)
Flowers can hear buzzing bees... Did you know? I had no idea.    

Welcome to my online space where I keep track of things I enjoyed creating, researching, and learning. This is an ever-evolving space; always expanding to fit new "furniture". If you have an interesting piece of "furniture", I'd love to borrow it.

(*Furniture is a metaphor, please don't think it's a furniture website*)

## FAQ
People like to ask questions. People seeing this for the first time may also have questions. I answer some of the questions I predict with my psychic abilities (a.k.a common sense).

### 1. Which person?
Linux command `which` + me, a `person` = `which person` ðŸ¤¯

### 2. Why a room?
I fit the generic nerd stereotype where I stay in my room forever, typing away on a keyboard for hours in the dark.

### 3. I have furniture for you. Where do you live?
Well, that's a bit of a personal question and I'm a private person. I can't tell you where I live, but I can give you my email address.
